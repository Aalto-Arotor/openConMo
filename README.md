# openConMo
This is a Python library for vibration signal based condition monitoring library developed in Aalto University, Finland. The objectives of this library are as follows:

1. Provide easy access to reproducing signal based condition monitoring papers
2. Enable comparison of AI/ML based techniques with conventional signal processing tools
